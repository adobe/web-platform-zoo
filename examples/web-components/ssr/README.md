Experimental Server-Side Rendering of Web Components
-----

This _very_ experimental module uses
[puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)
to render Web Components server-side, outputting
<a href="https://caniuse.com/declarative-shadow-dom">Declarative Shadow DOM</a> (DSD)
elements generated by the Web Components used by the current page.

It is inspired by the following examples, with thanks to their authors:

As I write this in September 2023, it looks like the Firefox team 
<a href="https://fosstodon.org/@westbrook@mastodon.social/111065169529654218">committed to shipping DSD<a>
at the recent <a href="https://www.w3.org/2023/09/TPAC/">w3c TPAC</a>, which is fantastic news!

## Status

Not really interesting yet, as of September 19, 2023 I got just the basic mechanisms working.

## How to run this

Run this once:

    npm install
