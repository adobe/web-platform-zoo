  <h1>AI Agents playground</h1>
  <p class="warning">
    This is <b>experimental</b>, run at your own risk!
    <br/>
    The results are meant as examples only, and as is common with large language
    models you might get surprising results, depending on which language model you select.
    <br/>
    Those results are not meant to be used aynwhere except in this experiment.
    <br/>
    Note also that this page <b>downloads large model files</b> to your computer, possibly several gigabytes,
    when you run the agents below.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page is meant to help you understand the basics of how AI agents work.
    It runs 3 agents locally in your browser, using <a href="https://webllm.mlc.ai/">WebLLM</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first run takes some time as the language model is 
    downloaded in your browser. Once that's done, the example agents
    take a few seconds or even minutes to run, depending on the selected model and on how
    powerful your computer is.
  </p>
  <p>
    The agents are defined below, in plain text that you can
    modify at will to experiment.
  </p>
  <p>
    An input text, found below, is fed to the first agent, and other agents get
    the output of the previous one as their input.
  </p>
  <p>
    To run this, your browser needs to support WebGPU.
    You'll get an error message if that's not the case, in the "status"
    field of the "output" section. Recent versions of Chrome work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Look at the "output" section at the end of this page to see what's
    happening, as well as the results. The agents run automatically when
    the page is loaded, and you can run them again using the "run" button 
    in that section of the page.
  </p>
  <h2>Agent Definitions</h2>
  <p>
    As mentioned, you can tweak these definitions as much as you want!
    Use the "run" button below to re-execute the agents after
    modifying their parameters.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code that runs these agents is quite simple, and all agents run the same code. 
    It is only the textual behavior definitions below that make them perform different actions.
  </p>
  <agent-definition>
    <h3>First agent</h3>
    <h4>Name</h4>
    <p class="note">Give a descriptive name to this agent.</p>

    </textarea>
    <h4>Backstory</h4>
    <p class="note">Describe the characteristics or "personality" of the agent.</p>
    <textarea class="backstory">
      You are a gifted and funny story writer, who invents stories using an input phrase as inspiration. 
      Your stories are in the same language as the input phrase.
      Jokes are common in your stories, which always have a happy and uplifting spirit.

  <h2>Input</h2>
  <p class="note">Many models support other languages besides English, try it!.</p>
