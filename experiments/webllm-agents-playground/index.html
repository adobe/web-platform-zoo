  <h1>Experimental AI Agents/WebLLM playground</h1>
  <p class="warning">
    This is <b>experimental</b>, run at your own risk!
    <br/>
    There is a remote possibility that running this example might even
    <em>crash your computer</em> - take appropriate precautions before
    hitting the "run" button below.
    <br/>
    The results are meant as examples only, and as is common with large language
    models you might get surprising results, depending on which model you select.
    <br/>
    Those results are not meant to be used aynwhere except in this experiment.
    <br/>
    Note also that this page <b>downloads large model files</b> to your computer, possibly several gigabytes,
    when you run the agents below.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page is an experiment with client-side Large Language Models, meant to help you understand the basics
    of how AI agents work.
    It runs 3 agents <em>locally in your browser</em>, using <a href="https://webllm.mlc.ai/">WebLLM</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    An input text, found below, is fed to the first agent, and other agents get
    the output of the previous one as their input.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first run may take some time as the language model downloads to your browser.
    After that, the example agents will take a few seconds to a few minutes to run,
    depending on the selected model and your computer's power.
    Try a smaller model initially, as indicated by the "size" value
    in the list of models below.
  </p>
  <p>
    To run this, your browser needs to support <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/">WebGPU</a>.
    You'll get an error message if that's not the case, in the "output" section below.
    Recent versions of Chrome work, see <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=webgpu">caniuse.com</a>
    or use the <a href="https://webgpureport.org/">WebGPU report</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    After starting the agents with the below button, look at the "output" section at the end of
    this page to see what's happening and get the results.
  </p>
  <h2>Agent Definitions</h2>
  <p>
    In this section, you can tweak the agent definitions as much as you want.
    Use the "run" button below to re-execute them after
    modifying their parameters.
    Starting without changes is recommended so that you get some initial results
    to help you understand how this all works.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code that runs these agents is quite simple, and all agents run the same code. 
    It is only the textual behavior definitions below that make them perform different actions.
  </p>
  <agent-definition>
    <h3>First agent</h3>
    <h4>Name</h4>
    <p class="note">Give a descriptive name to this agent.</p>
    <textarea class="name">
      Story Writer
    </textarea>
    <h4>Goal</h4>
    <p class="note">Describe what the agent must do.</p>
    <textarea class="goal">
      Write a story which is 2-3 paragraphs long.
    </textarea>
    <h4>Backstory</h4>
    <p class="note">Describe the characteristics or "personality" of the agent.</p>
    <textarea class="backstory">
      You are a gifted and funny story writer, who invents fun stories using an input phrase as inspiration. 
      Your stories are in the same language as the input phrase.
    </textarea>
  </agent-definition>

  <agent-definition>
    <h3>Second agent</h3>
    <h4>Name</h4>
    <textarea class="name">
      Summarizer
    </textarea>
    <h4>Goal</h4>
    <textarea class="goal">
      Output a 1-2 paragraphs summary of your input.
    </textarea>
    <h4>Backstory</h4>
    <textarea class="backstory">
      You summarize text, writing concise but precise summaries of your input.
      Your output consists only of the summarized text, with no comments.
    </textarea>
  </agent-definition>

  <agent-definition>
    <h3>Third agent</h3>
    <h4>Name</h4>
    <textarea class="name">
      Formalizer
    </textarea>
    <h4>Goal</h4>
    <textarea class="goal">
      Output a more formal version of the input text.
    </textarea>
    <h4>Backstory</h4>
    <textarea class="backstory">
      You are a stern person who always speaks in a very formal language. Fun is not part of your world.
      Given an input text, you will output another text with same meaning but in your formal style.
    </textarea>
  </agent-definition>

  <h2>Input</h2>
  <p class="note">Many models support other languages besides English, try it!.</p>
  <textarea id="input">
    Once upon a time, there was a rabbit named Plastikk Yoda, who liked 
    to run quickly in the fields, while playing a brightly colored kazoo.
  </textarea>

  <h2>Output</h2>
