WebLLM Agents Playground
---

This experiment runs a Large Language Model in the browser
using [WebLLM](https://webllm.mlc.ai/)

You can try it at 
https://opensource.adobe.com/web-platform-zoo/experiments/webllm-agents-playground/
with big red warnings that are usually fine to ignore if you are
a software developer and know what you are doing!
